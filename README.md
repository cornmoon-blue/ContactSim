# ContactSim
An experimental simulator to extract short range contact opportunities from GPS vehicles trajectories.
In Opportunistic Networks, the contact means the mobile nodes can communicate with each other by the wireless technology.
Beacuse nodes are mobile, the contact happens and continues uncertainly. This explains the meanning 'Opportunistic'.
